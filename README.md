About This:
</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Carcass â€“ an English project that provides a comprehensive character analysis of Julius Caesar. In this project, you will delve into the fascinating world of one of the most renowned figures in ancient history and explore the various facets of his character. Made this website for scratch with every process really be enjoyable and fun because this is what I love doing and find as a hobby (learning code and doing code). Implementing a smooth and responsive design while learning build aspects for this creative process was amazing. Thank you Mr.Ostrovsky!</p>

<br />

<h2>The English Project</h2>
<p>The site is focused on the specific character analysis of Julius Caesar as I really think he is the main "hero" and the entire storyline and arrangement revolves around him. Personally, when making this, I chose the important qualities, traits, and quotes that stood out to bring his real character presentable to YOU! the user. The way he interacted with other characters and his surrounds was how I found the story to be very interesting with the twists and turns that happened throughout. Things like his over confidence, ambition for constant power, and tragic flaw of trust were key to the encapsulation of his analysis given in a first perspective manner give flavor to this presentation. I'm very satisfied the way the entire flow and design of the site turned out.</p>
<h2>Website and Build Design</h2>
<p>I decided to go with a very clean design that was responsive using <b>Component based Architecture with <a href="https://react.dev/">React JS</a></b> to all devices and users (give it a try on your phone!) with smooth UI and UX appealing to the user like clean flow, transitions, hover effects, and high quality images.</p>
