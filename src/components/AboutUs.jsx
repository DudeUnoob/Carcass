      <h1>Literary Devices describing Me</h1>
      <p>
        <li>
          Metaphor: ""But, as he was ambitious, I slew him" (Act 3, Scene 2, line 27)" this quote from Brutus uses this metaphor 
          of ambition to a deadly diseases that must be cut out implying that Caesar's ambition is the cause of his downfall
        </li>
        <li>
          Personification: "Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death but once" (Act 2, Scene 2, lines 32-33). Caesar uses personification 
          as a way to personify <i>death as a taste</i> implying that it is something to be experienced.
        </li>
        <li>Soliloquy: "I could be well moved if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me, but I am constant as the northern star" (Act 2, Scene 2, lines 115-117). 

          This use of soliloquy shows the arrogant nature of Caesar and his inability to change course keeping a fixed mind and determination disregarding any destruction or caution.
        </li>

      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        I chose this character analysis of Caesar because it holds a great signficance to understanding the complexities of the play and central themes.
        His multi-dimentional character embodies ambition, power, pride, and tragedy. Through this character, Shaespeare is able to explore the dynamics of his leadership
        as well as the consequences of his ambition and fragility of too much power. Caesar's actions and motiviations are the leading cause to driving the plot of the play, shaping
        the destiny of other characters and ultimately leading to his downfall. Readers are able to gain an insight into his personality, flaws, and choices providing a rich foundation
        to analyze his events and themes of the play. This also allows us to explore his relationships with other characters such as Brutus, Cassius, and Mark Antony.
      </p>
      <h1>Our History and connection to the Present</h1>
      <p>
        The character analysis holds relevance connection to a modern-day, historical, and literary examples as Caesar's character
        still reflects human traits of ambition, power, and pride still prevalent in contemporary society. The consequences of his actions
        and the themes in the play, such as unchecked ambition resonate in modern times. For example, in politics and leadership, the pursuit of 
        power and ambition has far reaching consequences such as the reign of Hitler. These historical figures and dictators who have risen
        to power through ambition and manipulatino have faced tragic consequences paralleling that of Caesar's character. 
        In literature, we can see characters of similar traits like Macbeth in Shakespeare work or "Houst of Cards" of Frank Underwood's TV series.
