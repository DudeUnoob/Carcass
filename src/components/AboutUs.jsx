      <h1>Literary Devices describing Me</h1>
      <p>
        <li>
          Metaphor: ""But, as he was ambitious, I slew him" (Act 3, Scene 2, line 27)" this quote from Brutus uses this metaphor 
          of ambition to a deadly diseases that must be cut out implying that Caesar's ambition is the cause of his downfall
        </li>
        <li>
          Personification: "Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death but once" (Act 2, Scene 2, lines 32-33). Caesar uses personification 
          as a way to personify <i>death as a taste</i> implying that it is something to be experienced.
        </li>
        <li>Soliloquy: "I could be well moved if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me, but I am constant as the northern star" (Act 2, Scene 2, lines 115-117). 

          This use of soliloquy shows the arrogant nature of Caesar and his inability to change course keeping a fixed mind and determination disregarding any destruction or caution.
